<h1 id="mappers">Mappers</h1>
<p>Mappers are a pattern used in enterprise application development to provide a consistent and abstracted way to map between different data models. They act as an abstraction layer between the application and the data storage, providing a consistent and simple API for data transformation.</p>
<p>A mapper is a component that can be used to convert data from one format or model to another. For example, a mapper can be used to convert data from a database model to a domain model, or from a domain model to a data transfer object (DTO).</p>
