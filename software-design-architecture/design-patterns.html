<h1 id="design-patterns">Design Patterns</h1>
<p>Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that arise in software development. They provide a way to describe and communicate proven solutions to common design problems and they provide a common vocabulary for design. They are not specific to any particular programming language or technology, but rather describe the problem and the solution in a way that can be applied to many different contexts.</p>
<p>There are several different types of design patterns, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creational patterns</li>
<li>Structural patterns</li>
<li>Behavioral patterns</li>
<li>Architectural patterns</li>
</ul>
