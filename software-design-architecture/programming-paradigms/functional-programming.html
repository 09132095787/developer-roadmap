<h1 id="functional-programming">Functional Programming</h1>
<p>Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. It is a way of writing computer programs that emphasizes the use of functions and mathematical concepts, such as recursion, rather than using objects and classes like in object-oriented programming. In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions and returned as values.</p>
<p>Functional programming encourages immutability, which means that once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. This can simplify code, as it eliminates the need for state management and the bugs that can come with it.</p>
