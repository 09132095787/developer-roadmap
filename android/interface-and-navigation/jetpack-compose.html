<p><code>Jetpack Compose</code> is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs. <code>Jetpack Compose</code> offers a declarative approach to designing UI, where you can simply describe what your UI should look like at any given point of your appâ€™s state, and <code>Compose</code> takes care of updating the view hierarchy, making UI development more efficient. It also integrates well with existing Android apps, letting you adopt its benefits at your own pace.</p>
