<p>Sure, I can provide information about “app shortcuts” feature in Android.</p>
<h3 id="app-shortcuts-1">App Shortcuts</h3>
<p>App shortcuts in Android are designed to provide quick and convenient routes to specific actions or functions within your app from the device home screen. To use them, long-press an app’s icon and a pop-up menu will appear with the available shortcuts. Depending on the app, you might be able to send a message, make a booking, navigate home, or perform some other specific task without having to first open the app and navigate to the desired function. These shortcuts can also be moved and placed individually on the home screen for even faster access.</p>
