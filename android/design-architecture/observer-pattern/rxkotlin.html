<h1 id="rxkotlin">RxKotlin</h1>
<p><code>RxKotlin</code> is a lightweight library that adds convenient extension functions to <code>RxJava</code>. It allows developers to use RxJava with Kotlin in a more idiomatic way, thus making code more readable and understandable. While <code>RxJava</code> is a Java-based implementation of Reactive Extensions, <code>RxKotlin</code> is essentially a wrapper that includes extension functions and other constructs to take full advantage of Kotlinâ€™s features, such as its syntactic simplicity and ease of use.</p>
