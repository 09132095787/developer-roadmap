<h1 id="recursion">Recursion</h1>
<p>One of the most powerful and elegant concept of functions, recursion is when a function invokes itself. Such a function is called a <strong><em>recursive function</em></strong>. As recursion happens, the underlying code of the recursive function gets executed again and again until a terminating condition, called the <em>base case</em>, gets fulfilled. As you dive into the world of algorithms, youâ€™ll come across recursion in many many instances.</p>
