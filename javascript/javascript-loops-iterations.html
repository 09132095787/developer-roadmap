<p>Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.</p>
<p>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea “Go five steps to the east” could be expressed this way as a loop:</p>
<pre class="astro-code dracula" style="background-color:#282A36;color:#F8F8F2; overflow-x: auto;" tabindex="0" lang="plaintext"><code><span class="line"><span>for (let step = 0; step &#x3C; 5; step++) {</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>  console.log('Walking east one step');</span></span>
<span class="line"><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
