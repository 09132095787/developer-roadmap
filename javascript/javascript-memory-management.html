<h1 id="memory-management">Memory Management</h1>
<p>Low-level languages like C, have manual memory management primitives such as malloc() and free(). In contrast, JavaScript automatically allocates memory when objects are created and frees it when they are not used anymore (garbage collection). This automaticity is a potential source of confusion: it can give developers the false impression that they donâ€™t need to worry about memory management.</p>
