<h1 id="spring-data-jdbc">Spring Data JDBC</h1>
<p>Spring Data JDBC is a part of the Spring Data project that provides support for using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with relational databases. It is designed to provide a simple and consistent programming model for interacting with databases using JDBC, while still allowing for the full power of JDBC to be used if needed. Spring Data JDBC provides a set of abstraction and utility classes that simplify the task of working with databases, such as a simple template class for executing SQL queries, a repository abstraction for implementing data access objects (DAOs), and support for pagination and sorting of query results. It works with both Java and Kotlin.</p>
