<h1 id="generator-compressions">Generator Compressions</h1>
<p>Generator comprehensions are a concise way to create a generator using a single line of code in Python. They are similar to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a list, they create a generator object that produces the values on-demand, as they are needed.</p>
<p>Generator comprehensions are a useful tool for creating generators that generate a large sequence of values, as they allow you to create the generator without creating the entire sequence in memory at once. This can be more efficient and use less memory, especially for large sequences.</p>
