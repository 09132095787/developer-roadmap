<p>Package managers allow you to manage the dependencies (external code written by you or someone else) that your project needs to work correctly.</p>
<p><code>PyPI</code> and <code>Pip</code> are the most common contenders but here are some other options available as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://python-poetry.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>Poetry</strong></a> : Manages dependencies via isolation</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pypa/pipx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>PIPX</strong></a> : Isolation-based app deployment, so you donâ€™t have to affect the system or user PIP libraries. It enables you to try individual python CLI tools without affecting other dependencies.</li>
</ul>
