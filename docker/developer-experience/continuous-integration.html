<h1 id="continuous-integration-ci">Continuous Integration (CI)</h1>
<p>Continuous integration is the idea of executing some actions (for example build, test, etcâ€¦) automatically as you push code to your version control system.</p>
<p>For containers, there are a number of things we may want to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build the container images</li>
<li>Execute tests</li>
<li>Scan container images for vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Tag images with useful metadata</li>
<li>Push to a container registry</li>
</ul>
