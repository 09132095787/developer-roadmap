<p>Code editors are programs specifically designed for editing, managing and writing source code. They offer a wide range of features that make the development process easier and faster. Here’s a brief introduction to some of the most popular code editors for C++:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Visual Studio Code (VSCode)</strong>: Visual Studio Code is a popular, free, open-source, and lightweight code editor developed by Microsoft. It has built-in support for C++, along with an extensive library of extensions and plugins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sublime Text</strong>: Sublime Text is a cross-platform text editor that is quite popular among developers due to its speed and minimalist design. It supports C++ with the help of plugins and has a variety of themes and packages available for customization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CLion</strong>: CLion is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by JetBrains specifically for C and C++ developers. It provides advanced features like code completion, refactoring support, debugging, and more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a few examples, and there are many other code editors available, including Atom, Notepad++, and Geany. They all have their features and may suit different developers’ needs. Finding the right code editor is often a matter of personal preference and workflow.</p>
<p>To work with C++ in your chosen code editor, you often need to install some additional tools and add-ons, such as compilers, linters, and debugger support. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the editor’s documentation to set up C++ correctly.</p>
