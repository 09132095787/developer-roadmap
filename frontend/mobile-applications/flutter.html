<h1 id="flutter">Flutter</h1>
<p>Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, it allows you to create a native mobile application with only one codebase. This means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (for iOS and Android).</p>
<p>Flutter consists of two important parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>An SDK (Software Development Kit): A collection of tools that are going to help you develop your applications. This includes tools to compile your code into native machine code (code for iOS and Android).</li>
<li>A Framework (UI Library based on widgets): A collection of reusable UI elements (buttons, text inputs, sliders, and so on) that you can personalize for your own needs.
To develop with Flutter, you will use a programming language called Dart. The language was created by Google in October 2011, but it has improved a lot over these past years.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dart focuses on front-end development, and you can use it to create mobile and web applications.</p>
<p>If you know a bit of programming, Dart is a typed object programming language. You can compare Dartâ€™s syntax to JavaScript.</p>
