<h1 id="noisy-neighbor">Noisy Neighbor</h1>
<p>Noisy neighbor refers to a situation in which one or more components of a system are utilizing a disproportionate amount of shared resources, leading to resource contention and reduced performance for other components. This can occur when a system is not properly designed or configured to handle the workload, or when a component is behaving unexpectedly.</p>
<p>Examples of noisy neighbor scenarios include:</p>
<ul>
<li>One user on a shared server utilizing a large amount of CPU or memory, leading to reduced performance for other users on the same server.</li>
<li>One process on a shared server utilizing a large amount of I/O, causing other processes to experience slow I/O and increased latency.</li>
<li>One application consuming a large amount of network bandwidth, causing other applications to experience reduced throughput.</li>
</ul>
