<h1 id="instrumentation">Instrumentation</h1>
<p>Instrumentation is a critical part of the monitoring process. You can make meaningful decisions about the performance and health of a system only if you first capture the data that enables you to make these decisions. The information that you gather by using instrumentation should be sufficient to enable you to assess performance, diagnose problems, and make decisions without requiring you to sign in to a remote production server to perform tracing (and debugging) manually. Instrumentation data typically comprises metrics and information thatâ€™s written to trace logs.</p>
