<p>As a Quality Assurance Engineer, your job is to look for the weak spots in a product, whatever that product may be, and report them back, so that they can be fixed and thus, the product you are working on can be of the highest quality possible.</p>
<p>To do your job successfully, you need to have a Testing mindset. What does that mean? Among other things, it means you have to think in the most destructive way possible and be as creative as possible.</p>
<p>A few important points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Know the product you are testing</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to think outside of the box when you are testing it</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to misuse it as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
