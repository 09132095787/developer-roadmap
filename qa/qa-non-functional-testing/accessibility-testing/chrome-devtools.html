<h1 id="chrome-dev-tools">Chrome dev tools</h1>
<p>These are a set of tools built into the browser to aid frontend developers diagnose and solve various issues in their applications — such as JavaScript and logical bugs, CSS styling issues or even just making quick temporary alterations to the DOM.</p>
<p>To enter the dev tools, right click and click <strong>Inspect</strong> (or press <code>ctrl+shift+c</code>/<code>cmd+opt+c</code>) to enter the Elements panel. Here you can debug CSS and HTML issues. If you want to see logged messages or interact with javascript, enter the <strong>Console</strong> tab from the tabs above (or press <code>ctrl+shift+j</code>/<code>cmd+opt+j</code> to enter it directly). Another very useful feature in the Chrome dev tools is the Lighthouse (for checking performance) — more on this later.</p>
<p>NOTE: This isn’t a chrome-specific feature, and most browsers (Chromium based or otherwise) will have their own, largely-similar set of devtools.</p>
