<h1 id="directed-graph">Directed Graph</h1>
<p>A directed graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are directed from one vertex to another. A directed graph is sometimes called a digraph or a directed network. In contrast, a graph where the edges are bidirectional is called an undirected graph.</p>
