<h1 id="kruskals-algorithm">Kruskal’s algorithm</h1>
<p>Kruskal’s algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph. It is a minimum spanning tree algorithm that takes a graph as input and finds the subset of the edges of that graph which form a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for each connected component).</p>
