<h1 id="dynamodb">DynamoDB</h1>
<p>Amazon DynamoDB is a fully-managed, NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that can be used to store and retrieve large amounts of data. It is a highly-scalable, fast, and flexible NoSQL database service that supports both document and key-value data models.</p>
<p>DynamoDB is designed to handle extremely high levels of read and write throughput, and it automatically scales to accommodate the traffic of an application. It also provides built-in support for data replication, allowing data to be automatically spread across multiple availability zones for increased durability and availability.</p>
