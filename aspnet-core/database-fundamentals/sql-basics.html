<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL lets you access and manipulate databases
SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987.</p>
<p>Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.</p>
<p>However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.</p>
