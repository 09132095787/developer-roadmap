<h1 id="typescript-vs-javascript">TypeScript vs JavaScript</h1>
<p>TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional type annotations and other features such as interfaces, classes, and namespaces. JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language that is primarily used for client-side web development and can also be used for server-side development.</p>
<p>Here are a few key differences between TypeScript and JavaScript:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Types</strong>: TypeScript has optional type annotations while JavaScript is dynamically-typed. This means that in TypeScript, you can specify the data type of variables, parameters, and return values, which can help catch type-related errors at compile-time.</li>
<li><strong>Syntax</strong>: TypeScript extends JavaScript syntax with features like interfaces, classes, and namespaces. This provides a more robust and organized structure for large-scale projects.</li>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong>: TypeScript has better tooling support, such as better editor integration, type checking, and code refactoring.</li>
<li><strong>Backwards Compatibility</strong>: TypeScript is fully compatible with existing JavaScript code, which means you can use TypeScript in any JavaScript environment.</li>
</ul>
