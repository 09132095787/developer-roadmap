<p>The <strong>quaternion</strong> is a complex number system that extends the concept of rotations in three dimensions. It involves four components: one real and three imaginary parts. Quaternions are used in game development for efficient and accurate calculations of rotations and orientation. They are particularly useful over other methods, such as Euler angles, due to their resistance to problems like Gimbal lock. Despite their complex nature, understanding and implementing quaternions can greatly enhance a gameâ€™s 3D rotational mechanics and accuracy.</p>
