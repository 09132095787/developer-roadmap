<p>The term “API” stands for Application Programming Interface. In simple terms, a <em>Game API</em> is a set of protocols and tools used for building software and applications. It is, essentially, a method for different software applications to communicate with each other. In terms of game development, Game API provides a bridge to interact with the game engine, allowing developers to script in-game behaviors or functionalities, like graphics rendering, physics calculations, sound, and AI (Artificial Intelligence). Popular game APIs include DirectX and OpenGL. DirectX is used widely in the development of video games for Windows and Xbox. OpenGL, on the other hand, is a cross-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics in video games.</p>
