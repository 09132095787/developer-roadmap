<p>A key-value database (KV database) is a type of database that stores data as a collection of key-value pairs. In a KV database, each piece of data is identified by a unique key, and the value is the data associated with that key.</p>
<p>KV databases are designed for fast and efficient storage and retrieval of data, and they are often used in applications that require high performance and low latency. They are particularly well-suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as log data and user profiles.</p>
<p>Some popular KV databases include Redis, Memcached, and LevelDB. These databases are often used in combination with other types of databases, such as relational databases or document databases, to provide a complete and scalable data storage solution.</p>
