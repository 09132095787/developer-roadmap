<h1 id="oauth">OAuth</h1>
<p>OAuth stands for <strong>O</strong>pen <strong>Auth</strong>orization and is an open standard for authorization. It works to authorize devices, APIs, servers and applications using access tokens rather than user credentials, known as “secure delegated access”.</p>
<p>In its most simplest form, OAuth delegates authentication to services like Facebook, Amazon, Twitter and authorizes third-party applications to access the user account <strong>without</strong> having to enter their login and password.</p>
<p>It is mostly utilized for REST/APIs and only provides a limited scope of a user’s data.</p>
