<p>POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) is a family of standards for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. It describes utilities, APIs, and services that a compliant OS should provide to software, thus making it easier to port programs from one system to another.</p>
<p>A practical example: in a Unix-like operating system, there are three <em>standard streams</em>, <code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> - they are I/O connections that you will probably come across when using a terminal, as they manage the flow from the <strong>standard input</strong> (stdin), <strong>standard output</strong> (stdout) and <strong>standard error</strong> (stderr).</p>
<p>So, in this case, when we want to interact with any of these streams (through a process, for example), the POSIX operating system API makes it easier - for example, in the <code>&#x3C;unistd.h></code> C header where the stdin, stderr, and stdout are defined as <code>STDIN_FILENO</code>, <code>STDERR_FILENO</code> and <code>STDOUT_FILENO</code>.</p>
<p>POSIX also adds a standard for exit codes, filesystem semantics, and several other command line utility API conventions.</p>
