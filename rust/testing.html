<p>“Testing” in Rust is a crucial part of any programming project. This procedure involves creating specific scenarios to determine whether your code functions as expected. Rust has built-in support for this via the <code>cargo test</code> command which will run your test functions. These test functions are typically marked with the <code>#[test]</code> attribute to signify that they are not regular functions but testing adjuncts. Rust also provides a few macros such as <code>assert!</code>, <code>assert_eq!</code>, and <code>assert_ne!</code> for comparison checks and confirming expected behavior.</p>
