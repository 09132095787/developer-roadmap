<p>To install Rust, navigate to the official website at <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.rust-lang.org</a> and download the appropriate installation file for your operating system. For UNIX systems like Linux and MacOS, installation is as easy as running a single command in the terminal. For Windows, you’ll be provided with a ‘.exe’ installer which you need to execute. Further instructions can be found on the download page of the website. Keep in mind that you’ll also need a linker of your operating system such as ‘gcc’. You can update your Rust version at any time by running <code>rustup update</code> in the terminal.</p>
