<p>For the Rust Programming Language, several Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and editors provide great support. <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> is highly preferred among Rust developers due to its support for Rust via the “Rust Language Server” or “rust-analyzer” plugins. <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IntelliJ-based IDEs</a> also support Rust through their plugin. Additionally, <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> and <a href="https://atom.io" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Atom</a> with respective Rust-enhancement plugins are also used. For a more terminal-centric approach, <a href="https://www.vim.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Vim</a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Emacs</a> are equipped with Rust modes. These IDEs and editors offer various features like auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and tools for debugging which prove useful for Rust programming.</p>
