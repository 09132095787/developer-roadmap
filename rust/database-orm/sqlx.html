<p><code>SQLx</code> is an extensible, async, pure-Rust SQL toolkit and ORM that provides a suite of macros and builders for interacting with databases. It enables you to interact directly with your database without having to write SQL-statements, but with the strong typing of Rust. SQLx supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and MSSQL and is compatible with the <code>tokio</code> and <code>async-std</code> async runtimes. SQLx ensures compile-time checking of your SQL queries, which significantly reduces runtime errors due to malformed SQL.</p>
