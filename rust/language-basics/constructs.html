<p>In Rust, “constructs” refer to different elements used to build the structure of the program. This includes variables, functions, data types, control flow statements, and more. <strong>Variables</strong> store data, and their mutable or immutable status is determined at their declaration. <strong>Functions</strong> are reusable blocks of code defined by the <code>fn</code> keyword. Data types in Rust are static and must be declared upfront. These include simple ones like integers, boolean, float, etc, and complex types like arrays, tuples etc. <strong>Control Flow</strong> structures help direct the flow of execution. These include <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>loop</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and more. Exception handling uses the <code>Result</code> and <code>Option</code> enums along with the <code>match</code> construct. Rust’s constructs like these come together to structure your program in a safe yet efficient manner.</p>
