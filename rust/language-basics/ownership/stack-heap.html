<p>In most modern computer systems, memory management is split into two main parts: the stack and the heap. The <strong>stack</strong> is a section of memory that grows and shrinks automatically as functions are called and return. The data stored on the stack must have a known, fixed size. The <strong>heap</strong> is a section of memory that is used for data that needs to persist for longer than a single function-call. Data with dynamic size is stored on the heap. Rust, like many languages, has facilities for using these two types of memory, allowing developers fine-tuned control over memory usage.</p>
