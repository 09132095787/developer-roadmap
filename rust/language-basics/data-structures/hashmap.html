<p>The <code>HashMap</code> in Rust is part of the standard library’s collections framework and it’s a generic collection of key-value pairs. It allows for the quick lookup, insertion, and removal of items using hashing. A <code>HashMap&#x3C;K, V></code> holds a mapping of keys of type <code>K</code> to values of type <code>V</code>. The keys are unique and when a key gets inserted for the second time with a different value, the new value replaces the old value. Rust’s <code>HashMap</code> uses a cryptographically strong hashing algorithm which can help avoid denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. It is however not ordered, so items may not be in the same order as they were inserted.</p>
