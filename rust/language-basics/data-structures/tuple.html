<h1 id="tuple">Tuple</h1>
<p>In Rust, a <strong>Tuple</strong> is a type of data structure that holds a finite number of elements, each having potentially different types. Elements in a tuple are accessed using a dot (<code>.</code>) followed by the index of the value we want to get. For example, to declare a tuple that includes a <code>32-bit integer</code>, a <code>single-byte unsigned integer</code>, and a <code>floating point number</code>, we would write <code>let my_tuple: (i32, u8, f64) = (500, 2, 20.5);</code> The index of elements in a tuple start from <code>0</code>. So, to access the first element, use <code>my_tuple.0</code>, the second element <code>my_tuple.1</code>, and so on. Tuples can also be used for multiple declarations and assignments. Tuples are particularly useful when you want to group together items of different types.</p>
