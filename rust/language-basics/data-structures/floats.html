<p>In Rust, <code>floats</code> are used to represent floating-point numbers. They are defined as numerical values with fractional components. Rust supports two types of floating-point numbers: <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>. These are 32-bit and 64-bit in size, respectively. <code>f32</code> is a single-precision float, while <code>f64</code> has double precision. The default type is <code>f64</code> because on modern CPUs itâ€™s roughly the same speed as <code>f32</code> but allows more precision. You can define a float in Rust like so: <code>let x: f32 = 3.0;</code>.</p>
