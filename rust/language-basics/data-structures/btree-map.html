<h1 id="btreemap">BTreeMap</h1>
<p>In Rust, <code>BTreeMap</code> is a generic collection that stores data in a sorted tree structure. More specifically, it uses a self-balancing binary search tree (a type of <code>B+-tree</code>). <code>BTreeMap</code>s implement the <code>Map</code> trait, including methods such as <code>get</code>, <code>insert</code>, <code>remove</code>, and many others. The data stored in a <code>BTreeMap</code> will be sorted by key, which allows efficient lookup, insertions, and removals. The keys of the <code>BTreeMap</code> must implement the <code>Ord</code> trait, which means they must be orderable. Because <code>BTreeMap</code>s store data in a sorted order, the iteration of keys and values will be in sorted order as well.</p>
