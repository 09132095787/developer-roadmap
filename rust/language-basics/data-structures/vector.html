<h1 id="vector">Vector</h1>
<p>A <code>Vector</code> in Rust, often referred to as <code>Vec</code>, is a growable, or dynamically-sized, array-like data structure that can store homogeneous types. It stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory, with the count of elements and capacity managed automatically by Rust. Unlike arrays, vectors do not need to have a predetermined size at compile time and their size can be increased or decreased at runtime. The <code>Vec&#x3C;T></code> holds its data on the heap. It maintains a pointer to the data, a length, and a capacity. The length is the number of elements currently stored in the vector, while the capacity is the total allocation in the memory. The key methods for a <code>Vec&#x3C;T></code> include <code>push()</code>, <code>pop()</code>, and <code>len()</code>, among others.</p>
