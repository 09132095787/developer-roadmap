<h1 id="linkedlist">LinkedList</h1>
<p>The <strong>Linked List</strong> in Rust is a sequence of nodes where each node consists of a value and a pointer/reference to the next node in the sequence. Linked Lists are primarily used for implementing higher level data structures such as stacks, queues and associative arrays. Rustâ€™s <code>std::collections</code> provides a <code>LinkedList</code> struct that is a doubly-linked list with O(1) insertion and removal at both the front and back, but with O(n) indexing.</p>
