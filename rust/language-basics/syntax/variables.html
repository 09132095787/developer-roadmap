<p>In Rust, variables are declared using the <code>let</code> keyword. They are immutable by default, which means once a value is bound to a variable, it cannot be changed. If you want to make a variable mutable, the <code>mut</code> keyword is used. So, if you wanted to declare a mutable variable <code>x</code> and assign it the value <code>5</code>, you would write <code>let mut x = 5;</code>. Variables can also be patterned. By default in Rust, variables are block-scoped. Rust also supports several types of variable attributes.</p>
