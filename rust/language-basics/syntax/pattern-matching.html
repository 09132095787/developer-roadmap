<p>In Rust, <code>pattern matching</code> is a robust tool that allows you to destructure data types and perform conditional checks in a succinct and clear way. The main structures used for pattern matching are <code>match</code> and <code>if let</code>. The <code>match</code> keyword can be used to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things. The <code>if let</code> allows you to combine <code>if</code> and <code>let</code> into a less verbose way to handle values that match a specific pattern. Itâ€™s basically a nice syntax sugar over a <code>match</code> statement.</p>
