<p>In Rust, control flow is managed through various structures like <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>for</code>, and <code>match</code>. The <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> structures are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. Similar to other languages, <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> are used for looping over a block of code. The <code>while</code> loop repeats a block of code until the condition is false, and the <code>for</code> loop is used to iterate over a collection of values like an array or a range. The <code>match</code> structure is a powerful tool in Rust which can be used for pattern matching. It goes through different cases and executes the block where the match is found.</p>
