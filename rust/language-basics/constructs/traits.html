<p>Traits in Rust programming language define shared behaviors. They are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behaviors required by a type. Anything with a certain trait will have the behavior of that trait’s methods. Traits are abstract, and it’s not possible as such to create instances of traits. However, we can define pointers of trait types, and these can hold any implementer of the trait. A trait is implemented for something else, which can be a concrete type or another trait.</p>
