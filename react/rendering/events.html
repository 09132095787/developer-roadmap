<h1 id="events">Events</h1>
<p>Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:</p>
<ul>
<li>React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.</li>
<li>With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.</li>
</ul>
