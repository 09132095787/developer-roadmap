<h1 id="flutter-inspector">Flutter Inspector</h1>
<p>It is a tool in the Flutter SDK that provides a visual representation of the widget tree in a Flutter app. It allows developers to inspect the widgets in their app, see the properties and styles applied to each widget, and interact with the app in real-time.</p>
<p>With the Flutter Inspector, developers can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Debug the widget tree and see how the widgets are laid out.</li>
<li>Modify properties of widgets in real-time to see the impact on the app.</li>
<li>Inspect the properties and styles of individual widgets, and view any errors or warnings.</li>
<li>Measure the performance of the app, including the frame rate and number of widgets.</li>
</ol>
