<h1 id="firebase-app-distribution">Firebase App Distribution</h1>
<p>Firebase App Distribution is a service provided by Firebase, a mobile development platform owned by Google, that makes it easy to distribute pre-release versions of a mobile app to testers and stakeholders.</p>
<p>With Firebase App Distribution, developers can upload a pre-release version of their Flutter mobile app to the Firebase platform, and then invite testers and stakeholders to download and test the app. Testers and stakeholders can provide feedback directly from the app, making it easier for developers to fix bugs and make improvements before releasing the app to the general public.</p>
