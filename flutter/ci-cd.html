<h1 id="cicd">CI/CD</h1>
<p>CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) is a software development practice that helps to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying mobile apps, including Flutter apps.</p>
<p>With CI/CD, developers can automate the build, test, and deployment process for their Flutter apps, making it easier to catch bugs and deploy new features quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>The key components of a CI/CD pipeline for a Flutter app are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Version control</li>
<li>Automated builds</li>
<li>Automated testing</li>
<li>Deployment</li>
</ul>
