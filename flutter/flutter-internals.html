<p>The internal workings of Flutter refer to the underlying mechanisms and architecture that make up the Flutter framework.</p>
<p>At a high level, Flutter is a reactive framework for building user interfaces, which means that it allows developers to build dynamic, responsive apps that update automatically in response to changes in the state of the app.</p>
<p>Flutter achieves this by using a unique rendering engine that is based on the Skia graphics library. The rendering engine allows Flutter to render complex animations and graphics with high performance, and it also provides a way for Flutter to manage the layout and size of widgets in the app.</p>
