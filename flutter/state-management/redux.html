<p>Redux is a state management library for Flutter, commonly used with the Flutter framework to manage the applicationâ€™s state. It helps to maintain a single source of truth for the state of the application, making it easier to understand, test and maintain the code. In Redux, the state is stored in a store and can only be updated through dispatching actions. The actions trigger the update of the state via reducers, which are pure functions that determine the next state based on the current state and the dispatched action.</p>
