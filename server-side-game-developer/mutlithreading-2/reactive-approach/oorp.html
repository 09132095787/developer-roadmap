<h1 id="oorp">OORP</h1>
<p><strong>Object-Oriented Reactive Programming (OORP)</strong> is a programming paradigm that combines object-oriented programming (OOP) and reactive programming. In OORP, developers design the system in terms of objects that communicate with each other through messages. These messages trigger functions or “reactions” in the receiving objects, hence the term “reactive”. Each object in OORP encapsulates state and behavior, follows inheritance, and promotes data abstraction, similar to traditional OOP. However, OORP operates in a more event-driven manner, responding to external events, changes, or transactions that occur over time or in response to other objects.</p>
