<h1 id="async-await-c">Async-await (C#)</h1>
<p><code>Async/await</code> are extensions of Promises in JavaScript that allow for handling asynchronous code in a more synchronous manner. Using <code>async</code> keyword before a function, means the function returns a Promise. On the other hand, <code>await</code> keyword is used to pause async function execution until a Promise is resolved or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillments. Before the <code>await</code> keyword, the Promise resolves to the actual value. Notably, <code>await</code> only works within async function block.</p>
