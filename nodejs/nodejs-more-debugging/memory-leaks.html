<h1 id="memory-leaks">Memory Leaks</h1>
<p>Memory leaks are caused when your Node.js app’s CPU and memory usage increases over time for no apparent reason. In simple terms, a Node.js memory leak is an orphan block of memory on the Heap that is no longer used by your app because it has not been released by the garbage collector. It’s a useless block of memory. These blocks can grow over time and lead to your app crashing because it runs out of memory.</p>
