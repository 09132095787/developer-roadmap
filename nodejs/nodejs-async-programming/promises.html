<h1 id="promises">Promises</h1>
<p>A promise is commonly defined as a proxy for a value that will eventually become available.
Asynchronous functions use promise behind the scenes, so understanding how promises work is fundamental to understanding how “async” and “await” works.
Once a promise has been called, it will start in a pending state. This means that the calling function continues executing, while the promise is pending until it resolves, giving the calling function whatever data was being requested.</p>
<p>Creating a Promise:
The Promise API exposes a Promise constructor, which you initialize using new Promise().</p>
<p>Using resolve() and reject(), we can communicate back to the caller what the resulting Promise state was, and what to do with it.</p>
