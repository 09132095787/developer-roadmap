<h2 id="what-is-an-orm">What is an ORM ?</h2>
<p>An ORM is known as Object Relational Mapper. This is a tool or a level of abstraction which maps(converts) data in a relational database into programmatic objects that can be manipulated by a programmer using a programming language(usually an OOP language). ORMs solely exist to map the details between two data sources which due to a mismatch cannot coexist together.</p>
